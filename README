DESCRIPTION
       Create a Table of thumbnail images, having a default size
       of 32x32 pixels.  Once we have a Photo of an image, shrink
       it by copying a subsample of the original to a blank
       Photo. Or maybe even zoom-in to expand it.

       Click on an animated GIF to play it like a QuickTime movie.
